# AquaLink: Connecting Water Enthusiasts through Collaborative Content

Welcome to AquaLink, a project aimed at enhancing the India Water Portal by enabling user-generated content through event posting, server-side rendering, and lazy loading techniques. This project is part of my application for the **Code for GovTech (C4GT) 2024** initiative.

## Project Overview

AquaLink is a Next.js application designed to connect water enthusiasts and foster collaboration on water conservation efforts. By providing a platform for sharing articles, events, opportunities, and translations, AquaLink aims to enrich the community's knowledge base and engage users in meaningful ways.

## Features

1. **Event Posting**: Users can create and share events related to water conservation and management.
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Efficiently render pages on the server to improve performance and SEO.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load components as they are needed to enhance the application's performance and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

## Project Objectives

- **User Contributions**: Allow users to post articles, events, and opportunities, and to translate content.
- **OAuth Authentication**: Enable users to log in using platforms like Drupal and Disqus.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement a system to manage user roles and permissions.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for submitting and managing content.

## Implementation Details

### Event Posting
Users can post events through a dedicated form. This feature is designed using Next.js dynamic routes and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
To improve performance and SEO, key pages are rendered on the server. This is achieved by utilizing Next.jsâ€™s `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` functions.

### Lazy Loading
Components and images are lazily loaded to reduce initial load times and improve overall application performance. This is implemented using React's `React.lazy` and Next.js's native image optimization capabilities.
